# EthscripTokenProtocol_Contract
EthscripTokenProtocol is a protocol designed to implement token splitting for Ethscription.  The split tokens are fully compatible with ERC20 and can be traded on Uniswap.  The splitting process is reversible, and the split tokens can still be converted back to ethscription, depending on the user's choice.
